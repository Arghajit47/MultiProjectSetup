# Selenium Project

Welcome to the Selenium project! This project is designed to demonstrate automated web testing using Selenium, a widely used open-source testing framework.

## Overview

Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers across different platforms and programming languages. In this project, we'll cover the basics of setting up Selenium, writing tests, and running them against a web application.

## Setup

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Selenium WebDriver
- Your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

### Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)

If you haven't already, download and install the JDK for your operating system. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use a package manager for your OS.

### Step 2: Configure Selenium WebDriver

You'll need to download the dependency appropriate Selenium WebDriver for your preferred browser(s). WebDriver allows Selenium to control the browser for automated testing.

- For Chrome: Download ChromeDriver Dependency from the [Selenium ChromeDriver](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-chrome-driver) and add in your Selenium Code.

### Step 3: Set Up Your IDE

Choose your preferred IDE for Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code). Ensure your IDE is properly configured to work with Java projects.

## Writing Tests

Once your environment is set up, you can start writing Selenium tests. Create a new Java project in your IDE and add Selenium dependencies to your project's build path.

Here's a simple example of a Selenium test:

```java
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class SeleniumTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize ChromeDriver
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

        // Navigate to a web page
        driver.get("https://example.com");

        // Perform actions on the web page (e.g., click buttons, fill forms, verify text)

        // Close the browser
        driver.quit();
    }
}
```

## Running Tests

You can run Selenium tests from your IDE or using build tools such as Maven or Gradle.
