# Playwright Project

Welcome to the Playwright project! This project demonstrates automated testing capabilities using the Playwright framework for web application testing.

## Overview

Playwright is a cross-browser automation library for end-to-end testing. It allows you to automate interactions with web pages in multiple browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, with a single API.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run tests:

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm: npm is automatically installed with Node.js. Check its installation by running `npm -v` in your terminal.
- A code editor: Use your preferred code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the `AssessmentPlaywright` directory:

   ```bash
   cd AssessmentPlaywright
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running Tests

Once the installation is complete, you can run the provided example tests:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will execute the tests defined in the `tests` directory using Playwright.

### Writing Your Own Tests

To write your own tests, create new test files in the `tests` directory. You can use the Playwright API to interact with web pages and perform various actions such as clicking elements, typing text, and asserting conditions.

Refer to the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) for detailed information on writing tests and using the Playwright API.
