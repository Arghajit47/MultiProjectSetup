# Multi-Project Setup: Cypress, Playwright, and Selenium

This repository contains multiple projects that utilize different testing frameworks: Cypress, Playwright, and Selenium. Each project is designed to demonstrate automated testing capabilities using these frameworks for web application testing.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Cypress Project

The Cypress project is located in the `AssessmentCypress` directory. Cypress is a modern end-to-end testing framework built for the modern web. It provides an easy-to-use interface for writing and running tests, along with powerful features such as time travel, snapshots, and automatic waiting.

### 2. Playwright Project

The Playwright project is located in the `AssessmentPlaywright` directory. Playwright is a cross-browser automation library for end-to-end testing. It allows you to automate interactions with web pages in multiple browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, with a single API.

### 3. Selenium Project

The Selenium project is located in the `AssessmentSelenium` directory. Selenium is a widely used open-source testing framework for web applications. It provides a suite of tools for automating web browsers across multiple platforms and programming languages.

## Getting Started
